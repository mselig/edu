    "One week in 2007, two friends (Dean and Bill) independently told me they were amazed at Google's spelling correction. Type in a search like [speling](http://www.google.com/search?q=speling) and Google instantly comes back with **Showing results for:** [**_spelling_**](http://www.google.com/search?q=spelling). I thought Dean and Bill, being highly accomplished engineers and mathematicians, would have good intuitions about how this process works. But they didn't, and come to think of it, why should they know about something so far outisde their specialty?\n",
    "\n",
    "I figured they, and others, could benefit from an explanation. The full details of an industrial-strength spell corrector are quite complex (you can read a little about it [here](http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/36180.pdf) or [here](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=52A3B869596656C9DA285DCE83A0339F?doi=10.1.1.146.4390&rep=rep1&type=pdf)). But I figured that in the course of a transcontinental plane ride I could write and explain a toy spelling corrector that achieves 80 or 90% accuracy at a processing speed of at least 10 words per second in about half a page of code.\n",

    "### How It Works: Some Probability Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "The call ```correction(w)``` tries to choose the most likely spelling correction for ```w```. There is no way to know for sure (for example, should \"lates\" be corrected to \"late\" or \"latest\" or \"lattes\" or ...?), which suggests we use probabilities. We are trying to find the correction $c$, out of all possible candidate corrections, that maximizes the probability that $c$ is the intended correction, given the original word $w$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\mathrm{argmax}_{c \\,\\in\\, candidates} P(c\\,|\\,w) \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $P(w)$ is the same for every possible candidate $c$, we can factor it out, giving:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\mathrm{argmax}_{c \\,\\in\\, candidates} P(c) \\, P(w\\,|\\,c) \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The four parts of this expression are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Selection Mechanism:** $\\mathrm{argmax}$\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    We choose the candidate with the highest combined probability.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "2. **Candidate Model:** $c \\,\\in\\, candidates$\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    This tells us which candidate corrections, $c$, to consider.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "3. **Language Model:** $P(c)$\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    The probability that $c$ appears as a word of English text. For example, occurrences of \"the\" make up about 7% of English text, so we should have $P(the) = 0.07$.\n",
    "    <br><br>\n",
    "4. **Error Model:** $P(w\\,|\\,c)$\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    The probability that $w$ would be typed in a text when the author meant $c$. For example, $P(teh\\,|\\,the)$ is relatively high, but $P(theeexyz\\,|\\,the)$ would be very low.\n",
    "\n",
    "One obvious question is: why take a simple expression like $P(c\\,|\\,w)$ and replace it with a more complex expression involving two models rather than one? The answer is that $P(c\\,|\\,w)$ is already conflating two factors, and it is easier to separate the two out and deal with them explicitly. Consider the misspelled word $w$=\"thew\" and the two candidate corrections $c$=\"the\" and $c$=\"thaw\". Which has a higher $P(c\\,|\\,w)$? Well, \"thaw\" seems good because the only change is \"a\" to \"e\", which is a small change. On the other hand, \"the\" seems good because \"the\" is a very common word, and while adding a \"w\" seems like a larger, less probable change, perhaps the typist's finger slipped off the \"e\". The point is that to estimate $P(c\\,|\\,w)$ we have to consider both the probability of $c$ and the probability of the change from $c$ to $w$ anyway, so it is cleaner to formally separate the two factors."

So we can make ```candidates(word)``` produce the first non-empty list of candidates in order of priority:\n",

We need a lot of data to do this well. If we want to look at the change of one character for another, given a window of two characters on each side, that's 26<sup>6</sup>, which is over 300 million characters. You'd want several examples of each, on average, so we need at least a billion characters of correction data; probably safer with at least 10 billion.\n",

With a better error model we can be more aggressive about adding obscure words to the dictionary. Here are some examples where the presence of obscure words in the dictionary hurts us: "
